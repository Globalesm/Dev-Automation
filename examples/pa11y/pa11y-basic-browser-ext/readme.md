## Tool: Accessibility Auditor Bookmarklet

This  tool, Accessibility Auditor, is not a browser extension tool made by pa11y, but rather a browser extension (bookmarklet) that performs accessibility tests using the [HTML CodeSniffer ruleset](https://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/Standards/WCAG2/), which just happens to be the ruleset that the pa11y engine uses by default.
