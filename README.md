View the [GitHub published](https://akingkci.github.io/Playbook-Automation/) page


## Overview
This is an overview of Section 508/Accessibility test automation as presented by DHS OAST. The assets are arranged by accessibility testing strategies and within those categories, arranged by the open source accessiblity testing tools DHS OAST has initially studied that provide good chances for accuracy and partial alignment with the DHS Section 508 sucess criteria as instructed by the ICT Baseline and The Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process for Web (verison 5).   

### Automated Accessibility Testing Strategies
This resource is first organized by testing strategy. An overall approach can be devised by integration the following Section 508/Accessibility strategies into the SDLC as follows:  

* [Developer Unit Testing](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/axe-core)
* [Automated Integration Testing](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/lighthouse)
* [Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery Pipelines](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/lighthouse)
* [Regression/Q.A. and Web Site Scanning & Remediation Strategies](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/lighthouse)  

### Compatible Accessibility Test Tools and Examples
Within the various accessiblity testing straties, the following open source accessibility test tools have been initially studied and both basic and advanced automated testing script examples have been provided by DHS OAST based on their technical accuracy and ability to provide at least a partial alignment to the DHS implementation of Section 508 through ICT Baseline and Trusted Tester 5 for web success criteria:  

* [Pa11y Accessiblity Test Engine](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/pa11y)
* [Axe-core Accessibility Ruleset Libarary](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/axe-core)
* [Google Lighthouse Acessiblity Engine](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/lighthouse)
* [Microsoft's Accessibility Insights for Web browser extension tool](https://github.com/akingkci/508-Test-Automation/tree/master/examples/lighthouse)
